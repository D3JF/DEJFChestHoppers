# DEJFChestHoppers
 A simple "hopper" plugin for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.
 
## Information

This plugin allows people to create "hoppers" by placing a chest on top of an iron block. Any items dropped on top of the chest will be sucked into the "hopper". The plugin works with most chest protection plugins, so it is a perfect tool for making mailboxes or other input-only containers. It can also come in handy for automatic farms. There is one command, `/hoppers`, which shows admins the locations of all hoppers in the world.
